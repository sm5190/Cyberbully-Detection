Well done. You made @RepLizCheney the most powerful Republican in Congress, simply for speaking the truth about Trump, and the #Insurrection. Why is that clear, undeniable truth so difficult for you?

 Please resign Bryan, #Wi01 deserves better."
9965,2021-05-13 13:13:30+00:00,"How ironic @MelissainJax, the vote to hold Trump accountable for the insurrection was public which is the only reason they knew how Cheney voted. But to oust Cheney, the vote was private.  The executioner always wears a hood so no one will know who to blame for the execution."

9968,2021-05-13 13:11:24+00:00,If that were true why did not one Republican stand up for Liz Cheney? For going against Trump policies? Why did they vote her out? Past Republicans? Swamp Republicans? They can go on down the road. https://t.co/pOxXAC5QnL

9971,2021-05-13 13:08:55+00:00,@gaskaggs My anecdotal observation is the most rabid MAGAs are culturally connected to this religious landscape but they aren‚Äôt churched. Trump fills the void in the psyche for them.  I think the theology is crazy but they might be better off and more rational if they went back to church.
